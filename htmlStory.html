      When I first started having a playing around with web development, I
      realised that html and css were the dynamic duo of the web world. I like
      to relate most things in life to maori aspects where I can so that I can
      relate to things a bit more. In this case the html was like the strong
      reliable structure of a whare. He was dedicated to providing a strong
      foundation and organising elements of a website, similar to the beams and
      posts of a wharenui that provide stability. With html I was able to build
      the essential parts of my site. A foundation made up of headings
      paragraphs adding links. But just like any whare if it was just the
      skeleton or foundation it would not feel or look complete. Thats exactly
      how my web page looked with just html. Thats when css came in to the play.
      She was like the tukutuku panels that line the walls of a whare beautiful
      patterns and colours , she was an artist. She was that missing something
      that took it from dull to wow. Adding fonts, layouts , hover effects and
      smooth transitions bringing life to my site . Learning to work with html
      and css gave my website a strong foundation , while css added beauty and
      style.

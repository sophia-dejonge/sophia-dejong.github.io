    <p>Kia ora! My name is Sophia. I come from a background where I've worn
      many hats (and some helmets along the way). From owning a cafe and
      running three businesses to raising two children on my own, I’ve done it
      all. The education system never felt right for me, so entrepreneurship
      became my passion. At 34 years old, I’m still figuring out my purpose,
      but I’ve somehow ended up here. A friend once told me that being a
      business owner means being a problem solver because all day, every day,
      you’re solving problems one after another. I definitely think I’m in the
      right industry now. Based in beautiful Tāmaki Makaurau, I'm on a coding
      journey, weaving together my love for learning, my whānau, and my
      personal development. Life's too short for bad code and bad kawhe. E
      noho rā, as I share my coding adventures.

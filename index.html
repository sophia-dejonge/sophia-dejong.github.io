    <h1>Sophia's Journey: Debugging Life's Code</h1>
    <p>
      Kia ora! I'm Sophia, a wahine M훮ori with a passion for all things tech.
      Based in beautiful T훮maki Makaurau, I'm on a coding journey, weaving
      together my love for learning, my wh훮nau and my personal development.
      Life's too short for bad code and bad kawhe. E noho r훮, as I share my
      coding adventures.

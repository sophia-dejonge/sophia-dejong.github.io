    <h1>My Learning Plan</h1>

    <h2>Long-Term Goal/Career Pathway:</h2>

    <p>
      My big goal is to become a skilled web developer, focusing on full-stack
      development. I want to dive into tech, work at some cool places, and keep
      getting better.<br />
      Alongside this, I'm keen to use my tech skills to start my own startup
      someday, making tech solutions that really help people and communities.
      <br />
      Mixing tech with my entrepreneurial spirit will let me bring fresh ideas
      to life and lead exciting projects.

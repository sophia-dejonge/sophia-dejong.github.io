    <h1>My Learning Plan</h1>
    <p>
      My long-term goal is to become a skilled web developer, eventually
      specialising in full-stack development. I want to work in the tech
      industry, contributing to cool projects and always learning new things.
      Alongside this, I dream of using my tech skills to fuel my entrepreneurial
      spirit. I would love to start my own tech company, creating solutions that
      really make a difference in people's lives and communities. By combining
      my technical skills with my entrepreneurial drive, I hope to bring new
      ideas to life and lead exciting projects from start to finish.

    <p>
      Understanding the differences between margin, border, and padding is
      crucial for effective web design. Margin creates space around elements,
      pushing them away from each other, while border acts as a visible outline
      that separates the element from its surroundings. Padding, on the other
      hand, provides internal spacing, ensuring content doesn't touch the
      borders directly.

    <h1>Importance of Neuroplasticity</h1>
    <p><pre>    
      Knowing about neuroplasticity and the brain's ability to change by forming
      new connections can combat mental health issues,recover from brain
      injuries and even improve their memory and learning. It means we can keep
      learning and adapting throughout our entire lives .<hr>
      I could focus on:
     ~Learning new things , just like how I am studying coding right now . I
      could take up a new hobby and push myself to try new things, this will all
      help my brain to grow and adapt . I could also meditate and practice
      mindfulness which creates a better environment for my brain to thrive .
      <hr>
      Ways to increase Neuroplasticity: Learn new skills , Being social ,
      Healthy Diet, Quality Sleep.

    <h2>Growth Mindset</h2>
    <p><pre>
      What it is and why it's relevant?
        -A growth mindset is not being afraid of change. 
        It's the belief that you can get better and smarter at things through learning and effort. 
        It's important to have a growth mindset because it helps
        you learn from mistakes , try new challenging things and you just keep improving . 
        Instead of having a fixed mindset where you aren't willing to try or do anything new .
      <hr>
      The fact that no matter what age you are its always possible to learn knew things really amazed me.
      I also think that it's cool that I've decided to take up coding. Something I had zero knowledge
      about but its great because it is challenging my brain to grow and adapt . This was a great refresher and reminder for me though I totally enjoyed it .
      <hr>
      I'll continue to adapt a growth mindset by:
      
    - Be eager to take on more challenges
    -Take all criticism as positive criticism.
    -Push through the setbacks.
    -Celebrate my efforts.

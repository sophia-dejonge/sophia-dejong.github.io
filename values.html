    <h1> My Values</h1>
    <h2>Ethical Decision-Making</h2>
    <p>
       I was the owner of a small Cafe
      in Papatoetoe called Dido Cafe and Covid really rocked our businesses. We
      were stuck with the hard decision of cutting costs. One of the areas we
      were focusing on was food prices so potentially changing suppliers for
      some of our produce. A sales rep knocked on our door and offered lower
      quality items for a lot cheaper meaning we might have actually been able
      to make some profit . But I'm big on quality and I couldn't do it . I
      chose to prioritise the integrity of our meals and keeping our customers
      satisfied. I decided to not change the quality of our food. Instead I
      spoke to our suppliers and they were able to bring prices down . </p>
      
      <h2>Influence of Culture and People </h2>
      <p>Being Māori significantly influences my values. I
      grew up surrounded by my elders , so the concepts of whanaungatanga and
      manaakitanga that they lived by daily was ingrained in me. These values
      impacted my business decisions, feeling strongly about community
      connections and how important it is to be kind and to care for others. I
      am very close to my family, and we all are very passionate about
      installing these same qualities and values into our tamariki and the
      future generations to come. My experiences with whānau and friends
      continually reinforce these values, highlighting the significance of
      relationships and support in my life.</p> 
      
      <h2>Identifying Strengths</h3>
      <p> I am very adaptable. I'm not sure if this is a good or bad thing but mostly it's
      good. It allows me to have an open mindset and I can 9 times out of 10
      adapt to any new situation I am in . This was extremely helpful while
      owning a business because I learnt very fast that every day is different
      and I may need to wear a different hat each day even if it is not my norm.
      I am also very good at Problem solving. I believe there's always “a way”
      you just have to figure it out . I realised business owners are just
      problem solvers , everyday that's basically all you're doing solving a
      problem one after the other. There are many more but I will stop there. My
      resilience has helped me persevere through difficult times, and has helped
      me through all avenues of my life.</p>
      
      <h2>Evaluating Limitations</h4>
      <p>A major
      limitation for me is taking on too much responsibility. I sometimes find
      it hard to say no and I just want to help people where and when I can but
      I'm a bit erratic in that sense which can sometimes lead to feeling
      overwhelmed, affecting my ability to get things done. I'm trying to be
      logical with my day to day responsibilities and workload and just stay in
      my lane. This approach allows me to focus on key aspects of the business
      while empowering my team.</p> 
      
      <h2>Working Productively with Others </h2>
      <p>Running Dido
      and managing staff was very challenging at times, working productively
      with others was super important and as long as everyone adds value and
      does their share of the workload the day would run smoothly. If one person
      is lacking it affects the whole team leading to tension and mistakes.
      Thinking about these situations highlights the importance of effective
      communication and understanding individual perspectives. So I am very
      confident that I can add value and work productively with others</p>
      
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
     <p> Thinking
      about all these topics and putting together the evidence for this
      reflection involved self-evaluation and asking feedback from my family and
      staff. I reflected on my experiences at Dido cafe to identify some of my
      core values and strengths. It was actually nice to take a moment and write
      some nice things about myself, what an awesome exercise .</p>
